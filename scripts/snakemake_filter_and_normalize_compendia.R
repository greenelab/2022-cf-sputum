# log ---------------------------------------------------------------------

# For filtering applications, use log-transformed data since it resembles more
# normal distributions. the hlog ("happy log") function takes the log of a 
# dataframe making sure the resulting data frame doesn't have any -Inf or NaN values.

# determine strain type from metadata -------------------------------------

# Since the compendium is composed of multiple strains and filtering criteria 
# are based on characteristic distributions across the compendium, we want to be
# able to build those distributions from samples aligned to their matched target
# reference to avoid alignment-based artifacts influencing the distributions. 
# To do this we will scrape all fields of the SRA run table to look for "PAO1" 
# and "PA14" to provide best-guesses of what strain each sample is, if annotated.

# search for PAO1
seq_strain_ann_pao1 <- rowSums(apply(run_table, 2, FUN = function(x){
  sapply(x, function(y){
    grepl('PAO1',y) | grepl('PA01',y) # since PAO1 is sometimes misspelled as PA01
  })
})) > 0
# search for PA14
seq_strain_ann_pa14 <- rowSums(apply(run_table, 2, FUN = function(x){
  sapply(x, function(y){
    grepl('PA14', y)
  })
})) > 0
# consolidate PAO11 and PA14 annotations
seq_strain_ann <- sapply(c(1:nrow(run_table)), function(x){
  if(seq_strain_ann_pao1[x]){
    'PAO1'
  } else if(seq_strain_ann_pa14[x]){
    'PA14'
  } else{'No annotation'}
})
# name the strain annotations to match compendium for easy indexing
names(seq_strain_ann) <- run_table$Experiment
                               
# re-order strain annotations  to path compendium samples

# examine core gene expression ---------------------------------------

# Using genes known to be stable in their expression as a normalization metric 
# is commonly used in qRT analysis and other mRNA quantification techniques.
# It can provide internal controls and account for technical biases. The same 
# concept can hold true when we look at gene expression across compendia. We can
# choose housekeeping genes for **P. aeruginosa** based on a publication and 
# examine their expression in the array compendium.

# The following set of HK genes comes from Alqarni et al 2016, J Microbiol Methods. 

## PAO1

                   function(x) name_to_PAO1(x))
# only include hk genes if they are in our compendium data

## PA14

hks_pa14 <- hks_pa14[hks_pa14 %in% rownames(rnaseq_pa14_tpm_log)]


# determine filtering criteria --------------------------------------------

# We will use the distributions of zero counts and median hk gene expression 
# across the compendium to determine lower and upper thresholding criteria to 
# exclude outlying samples. Using the PAO1- and PA14-aligned data, we can tailor 
# our thresholds to avoid misalignment artifacts by basing the thresholds for 
# each strain on samples of that matched strain.

pa14_zeros <- get_zeros(rnaseq_pa14_tpm_log[ , seq_strain_ann_order == 'PA14'], .1, .9)
# median hk expression lower and upper thresholds
# The following were the filtering thresholds used by the original compendia; 
# I've kept this code in to explicitly record what the thresholds were previously and how they have changed now
# pao1_hk <- get_hks(rnaseq_pao1_tpm_log[ , seq_strain_ann_order == 'PAO1'], hks_pao1, .2, .98) #.025,.975 #.2, .98
# pa14_hk <- get_hks(rnaseq_pa14_tpm_log[ , seq_strain_ann_order == 'PA14'], hks_pa14, .2, .98)

# I increased the range (decreasing the lower threshold from 0.2 to 0.7) to 
# increase the number of samples that are retained; 
# previously, all but one ASM sample and one M63 sample were dropped.
# With the decrease, all ASM and M63 samples are retained. 
# These samples are important controls that the analysis relies on, so I am 
# highly motivated to keep them in the filtered compendium.
pao1_hk <- get_hks(rnaseq_pao1_tpm_log[ , seq_strain_ann_order == 'PAO1'], hks_pao1, .07, .98) #.025,.975 #.2, .98
pa14_hk <- get_hks(rnaseq_pa14_tpm_log[ , seq_strain_ann_order == 'PA14'], hks_pa14, .07, .98)

# apply filtering -------------------------------------------------------

# Now that upper and lower thresholds have been determined, we can apply these 
# criteria across the compendium. I apply the zero-based and hk gene-based as 
# well as the PAO1-based and PA14-based criteria separately and then consolidate 
# in order to be able to re-trace which tests each samples passed and failed.

## PAO1

# consolidate to include samples that pass PAO1 or PA14 based criteria
filt_i <- filt_pao1_samp_i | filt_pa14_samp_i


# perform filtering -------------------------------------------------------

# For the final compendia we will keep samples that passed either both PAO1 
# zero- and hk-based criteria or both PA14 zero- and hk-based criteria. In this 
# way the PAO1 and PA14 compendia will contain the exact same set of samples, 
# just aligned to difference references.

# perform normalization ----------------------------------------------------

# After filtering out outlier datasets there is still a wide range of gene 
# expression distributions that vary sample-to-sample. This is in part due to 
# differences in read depth, though not entirely corrected by read depth 
# normalization such as TPM. This problem has been tackled for differential 
# expression analysis and so we employed a normalization methods used in the 
# DESeq2 method of DE analysis. This method, referred to as the median ratios 
# method (MR) calculates per sample size factors based on the ratio of median 
# expression in each sample to the median expression of a pseudo-reference sample
# defined as the geometric mean of all samples in the compendium. 

normalized_counts_pao1 <- MRnorm(out_rnaseq_pao1_counts)

# write out data ----------------------------------------------------------

# Save these compendia in TPM, counts snf normalized counts form noting the 
# 'p2' in the title indicating the parameter combination used for filtering.
